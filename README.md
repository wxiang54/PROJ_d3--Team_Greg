## Description of Dataset
* source: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html
* This dataset involves incomes of all races over time in the United States. The households are split into fifths (lowest fifth, second lowest fifth,..., top fifth) with an additional column displaying the income of the top 5% Americans. The fields in this data set are year, income (5 different columns for the 5 categories), and number of households (in thousands). 
* This dataset is significant because it allows us to visualize exactly how income has changed since over a long period of time (approx. 50 years). From the visualization, one can see whether the wealthiest households have grown richer, the poor households poorer, or whether there has been economic mobility. 

## Agar.io + $$$$$$^100104987372934 == our project
* The visualization will be similar to the game agar.io. 
* The independent variable in our project is time.
